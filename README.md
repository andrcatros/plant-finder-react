## Plant Finder
Plant Finder aims to provide an online alternative to in-person plant swap events that have been cancelled due to COVID. Users can create free accounts, post ads for plants, seedlings, seeds and other gardening materials they want to swap (for free) and browse posts by other users. In the first version of the app, users can contact each other through an 'email to' button, but in version 2 (currently under development) users will be able to send in-app messages.

This app was created by [Nicola Beswick](https://github.com/nic-bes), [Andreea Ros](https://github.com/andrcatros) and [Antonia Symeonidou](https://github.com/antoniasymeonidou). 

Technologies used include: React and SASS (for frontend), Express, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose and Multer (for backend).  

Check out the backend repo [here](https://github.com/andrcatros/plant-finder-api) and try out the deployed app on Vercel [here](https://plant-finder-react-2pj9xcnqm.vercel.app/).
